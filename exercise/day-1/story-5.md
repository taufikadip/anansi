 **"The Guessing Game"**
   - **Story**: You are simulating a guessing game. The secret number is 7, and the player makes a series of guesses: 5, 3, 7, 0. The game stops when the correct number is guessed or when the guess is 0.
   - **Question**: Use a `while` loop to iterate through the guesses and stop the loop when the correct number (7) is guessed or when the guess is 0. Use `break` when 0 is encountered.
