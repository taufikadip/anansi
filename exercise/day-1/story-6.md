 **"The Fuel Tank"**
   - **Story**: A car's fuel tank is filled in increments of 5 liters. The tank can hold up to 50 liters, but if the fuel exceeds 40 liters, the station stops early.
   - **Question**: Use a `while` loop to simulate filling the fuel tank, and stop the loop when the fuel reaches 50 liters or if it exceeds 40 liters.
